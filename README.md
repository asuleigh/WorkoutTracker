ABSTRACT: For this project I built and hooked in the backend of a fitness tracker app. This app uses a Mongo database, a Mongoose schema, and express for handling routes. A user can interact with the app to create a new workout, continue a previous workout, or see click the top left link to see charts of their progress.
